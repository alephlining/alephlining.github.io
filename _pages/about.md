I am a member of the ALGANT master program and I'm now a master student at [Mathematical Institute](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/mathematics/), [Universiteit Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/). I will move to [Universit√§t Regensburg](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/) the next year. My research interest includes Algebraic Geometry and Algebraic Topology.

You can find my CV here: [Ningyi Li's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV_Ningyi Li.pdf).
